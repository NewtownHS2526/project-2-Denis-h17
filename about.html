      <h3>Who are we:</h3>
      <p >This project was created to show how artificial intelligence can support mechanical engineering decisions. Our focus is on making engineering concepts easier to understand and apply.</p>
      <h3 >Our Mission:</h3>
      <p >To provide simple, helpful tools that guide users through material selection and basic engineering decisions using clear explanations and AI-powered reasoning.</p>
      <h3 >Why this Exists:</h3>
      <p >We believe that everyone should have access to easy-to-understand engineering knowledge. By combining AI with straightforward explanations, we aim to make technical concepts more accessible to students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in learning about materials and design. Choosing the right material can be confusing. Our goal is to make the process straightforward by combining engineering basics with the usefulness of modern AI.</p>
